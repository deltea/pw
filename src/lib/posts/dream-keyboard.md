so lately i've been really into the custom mechanical keyboard rabbit hole, and i also really want to do a hardware project. what better way to do that than to make a custom wireless keyboard?

first, here's what my ideal keyboard looks like:

- ortholinear (maybe staggered?)
- completely wireless (bluetooth)
- double-shot pbt keycaps
- keycaps that actually look good
- monochrome oled or e-ink display
- fn keys are on the number keys
- light and portable
- slightly slanted for comfort

i originally wanted to make a keyboard themed around the japanese probiotic beverage "yakult" because i found an amazing keycap set for it, but then it sold out, so i can't really do that now.

i don't really know what i want to theme the keyboard around now, so i'll need to think about it some more. this keyboard is not just for aesthetics, so i'll need to come up with the best layout for it. i've already decided that i want a split ortholinear keyboard, so maybe i can start with that?
