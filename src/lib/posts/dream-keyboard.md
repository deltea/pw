so lately i've been really into the custom mechanical keyboard rabbit hole, and i also really want to do a hardware project. what better way to do that than to make a custom wireless keyboard?

first, here's what my ideal keyboard looks like:

- ortholinear (maybe staggered?)
- completely wireless (bluetooth)
- double-shot pbt keycaps
- keycaps that actually look good
- monochrome oled or e-ink display
- fn keys are on the number keys
- light and portable
- slightly slanted for comfort

i originally wanted to make a keyboard themed around the japanese probiotic beverage "yakult" because i found an amazing keycap set for it, but then it sold out, so i can't really do that now.

one thing i'm not really sure about is whether i want high-profile or low-profile mechanical switches. i like pressing the normal mechanical switches, but i feel like low-profile switches are actually better for typing fast. i also need to take in account what keycaps will fit onto each type of switch, since i don't think you can just put any keycap on a low-profile switch. i like the low-profile keycaps, since they are all flat and more consistent, but there doesn't seem to be that many of them.

i don't really know what i want to theme the keyboard around now, so i'll need to think about it some more. this keyboard is not just for aesthetics, so i'll need to come up with the best layout for it. i've already decided that i want a split ortholinear keyboard, so maybe i can start with that?
